Mac and iOS software developers, mark your calendars: Apple's next Worldwide Developers Conference will take place the first week in June.Apple on Thursday announced that WWDC 2014 has been scheduled for June 2 to 6 and will take place where it's often been found in the past: San Francisco's Moscone West center.Tickets will be available through the WWDC Web site now through 10 a.m. PT Monday, but they'll likely be gone long before then. WWDC tickets typically are gone within the first couple hours after Apple puts them on sale. Last year, the conference sold out in mere minutes.Apple said that tickets will be issued through random selection and that developers will know their status by 5 p.m. PT Monday. Those selected will have to pony up $1,599 per ticket.The company plans to have more than 1,000 of its engineers at the conference to lead hands-on labs and other events to guide attendees through the inner workings of iOS and OS X.One big question leading into this year's WWDC: will Apple introduce iOS 8, and what new features will come in that next version of the mobile operating system? Rumors have suggested changes including Mac apps coming to the iPhone and iTunes Radio being broken out as a separate app. The most recent significant update, iOS 7.1, brought CarPlay for integrating the iPhone into car dashboards, along with updates to Siri and Touch ID.Last fall's OS X Mavericks release, meanwhile, brought some iOS features into the fold for Mac users. CNET reviewer Jason Parker considered the update "more evolutionary than revolutionary."But don't go looking for a merger of iOS and OS X. Apple execs have been quite clear that they consider such an effort a "waste of energy."
