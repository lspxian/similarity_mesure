The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have carried Prince George off the plane at the start of a three-week visit to New Zealand and Australia.

It is the first official tour for the eight-month-old prince, who was awake in his mother's arms as the trio were greeted at Wellington airport by Prime Minister John Key and waiting media.

It was only the second time the baby has faced the press.

The party were met with cold, wet and windy weather.

After greeting them on the tarmac, Mr Key tweeted: "The Royals have landed in Wellington. Let's make them very welcome, New Zealand."
