Apple this morning announced the dates for this year's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. As usual, the show will take place in the Moscone West convention center, and it will run from June 2 to June 6.The majority of the show is dedicated to technical sessions for OS X and iOS developers, but its day-one keynote has historically been used to unveil the next versions of those operating systems to the public. Apple has also been known to make smaller hardware announcements at the showâ€”we probably won't see a new iPad, but a new MacBook Air or Mac Mini isn't out of the question.In the past, Apple has sold WWDC tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, and in recent years this has made for a mad scramble that leaves many developers out in the cold. This year, tickets are being given out randomly to any registered developer who signs up on Apple's site by next Monday, April 7 at 10:00am PDT (1:00pm EDT). Those selected will be able to buy show tickets for $1,599 and will lose their spot if they don't buy a ticket by April 14. (They also won't be allowed to sell or give away tickets to anyone else.)As in past years, we'll be on the ground on the first day of the show to cover everything that Apple is announcing, and we're sure the rumor mill will go into high gear as June approaches. Stay tuned.
