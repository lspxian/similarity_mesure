A signal consistent with transmissions from the black box flight recorder and cockpit voice recorder of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight was picked up for more than two hours in the Indian Ocean, according to the head of Australia’s joint agency co-ordination centre.

In what may be one of the most promising leads yet in the search for the missing flight, the head of the Australian joint agency co-ordination centre, Angus Houston, announced on Monday that the Australian defence vessel Ocean Shield detected two separate signals within the northern part of the search area.

The first detection lasted two hours and 20 minutes, and the second lasted 13 minutes. The vessel is continuing to monitor the area to relocate the signal.

“Today I can report some very encouraging information which has unfolded over the last 24 hours. The towed pinger locator deployed from the Australian vessel Ocean Shield has detected signals,” he said.

“Significantly this would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.”

“All of the search underwater is being enabled by that wonderful work by the expert team in Kuala Lumpur. Their work has allowed us to come up with an underwater search area that is narrowly focused.”

Houston stressed that the lead, while promising, was not yet confirmation of the plane, but he said it was a “most promising lead”.
